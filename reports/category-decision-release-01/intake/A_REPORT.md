# Executed timing closure and product decisions — V1

**New exact-version saved-output joins completed:** B’s `B-QB-ALIGNED-FRESHNESS-v1` completion F0–F3 now have **2026 W1–5, 88 decided retained actual-line cases / 51 games** on A’s annual-source board. C’s exact C04 F0–F3 point rules now have **W1–5, 412 common decided cases / 53 games**, with broader board coverage retained. These extend A owner-local coverage; B’s four-week native panel and C’s two-week native panel remain separate. This replay adds no new games or original issuance.

**Replacement decision:** retain the stronger compatible controls. B’s new timing direction-mean gain is inconclusive and still below A CatBoost/HGB. C’s one-day means lose to their own seven-day baselines; its medians do not establish improvement. No A model release, new fit, model inference, or new original selection was performed for these joins.

## 1. Scope, records and independent checks

Requested primary window remains2026 W1–8. The tables below use only **`ANNUAL_NAMED_NJ`, W1–5**: retained real lines with **unverified quote/decision timing**, chronological/current-vintage reconstruction and exposed development outcomes. They are not authenticated original pregame selections or verified bookmaker returns.

- **B:** eligible88, forecast-selected88, decided88, unavailable/unknown/abstention/push0;51games/88player-games. Fixed shared mask. Saved fallback state is `none`; this is not independent fit reproduction. Mean, median and P2 are separate products; P2 matches median direction here and remains in machine tables.
- **C:** full annual eligible469, forecast-selected421 (**89.77%**),48unavailable,9selected participation-unknown,412decided;53games. Fixed pool 412/412, no pushes/abstentions. F2/F3 row fallback/profile/imputation flags are **UNKNOWN_NOT_EXPORTED**. Only F0/F1 reuse exact C03 flags.
- **W6–7 remain separate diagnostics:** B’s56 site-threshold rows and C’s255 additional decided rows do not turn this into seven qualified actual-offer weeks. No W8 retained offers in these joins. The unresolved W5 A/B source-overlap disposition remains separately source-bound; do not sum panels or treat repeated player-games as independent.
- Independent membership/side checks: [B calculation](B_TIMING_INDEPENDENT_CALCULATION_V1.json), [C calculation](C04_INDEPENDENT_ARITHMETIC_V1.json), and [public-projection validation](TIMING_PUBLIC_PROJECTION_VALIDATION_V1.json). No independent fit or historical quote-clock authentication.

## 2. Completion: exact new B F0–F3

Namespace **`B-QB-ALIGNED-FRESHNESS-v1`**; QB/full-game-OT completions; unchanged strict point-versus-line rule. F0 original inputs/seven-day; F1 profile/seven-day; F2 original inputs/aligned48-hour reconstruction; F3 profile/aligned48-hour reconstruction. The 48-hour policy is reconstructed. Each row: 88 eligible/selected/decided, 51 games, W1–5, same evidence tier.

**Strong controls on those same88 cases:** A `CATBOOST_MEDIUM / mean_objective_point` **25–13/38 Over;27–23/50 Under;52–36/88 (59.09%) combined**. A `HGB_MAE_DIRECT / mae_objective_point` ties combined52/88 with26–14/40 Over and26–22/48 Under. Always-Over48/88 (54.55%); Always-Under40/88 (45.45%). None of the new B products beats the better constant side or the52-win learned leaders here. B F2mean versus CatBoost is−5wins/−5.68points, game 95%[−15.82,+3.45], week 95%[−11.28,+1.59].

| Exact within-method contrast | Output | Change in wins | Change, percentage points | Game95%, points | Week95%, points |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| F1−F0: Profile under seven-day | mean | -3/88 | -3.41 | [-9.77, +2.91] | [-9.39, +1.35] |

| F3−F1: Timing with profile | lower_median | +4/88 | +4.55 | [-2.25, +11.18] | [+1.75, +6.61] |

B’s broader 2025/2026 numerical timing benefit remains in its original population. Here F2mean MAE improves5.12265→4.99811, but **F3mean MAE worsens5.09227→5.09373** versus F1. All Briers exceed the matched binary 0.25 reference. AUC/reliability remain in machine tables. No confidence, 90%, Top Picks or profitability claim follows.

**Decision:** timing/profile direction replacement **INCONCLUSIVE / KEEP_STRONG_RETAINED_CONTROL**; Preserve numerical benefits for scoped owner review; close this exact timing comparison without more lag/seed/offset/cutoff search.

## 3. Receptions: exact C04 point replay

Namespace **`C-RECEIVING-ALIGNED-TIMING-v1`**; WR/TE reception mean and median; unchanged unrounded point-versus-line rule. **F0 is the exact C03 R1 support baseline; F1 is C03 R2 player-profile**, both seven-day. F2/F3 use the corresponding aligned one-day timing sensitivity. **Typed points only**, no probability/Brier/confidence/EV. Each row: 412 fixed decided, 53 games, W1–5; outer board 469 offers.

| Exact arm / output | Over W–L/N/% | Under W–L/N/% | Combined W–L/N/% | MAE / bias | Brier | Own combined week 95% | Wins vs strongest retained |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

**Strong learned control:** retained `C::PLAYER-CONTEXT-MATCHUP-01::v1.1::P1::mean` scores **78–50/128 Over;161–123/284 Under;239–173/412 (58.01%) combined**. A Leaf mean238/412 and median236/412 remain visible; Always-Under211/412, Always-Over201/412. F2mean loses23wins to the239-win leader: game 95%[−10.37,−0.96]points, week 95%[−13.19,−1.94]. F3median loses5wins: game 95%[−4.85,+2.19], week 95%[−4.29,+0.80]. Do not label a constant-side gain as strongest-method superiority.

**Decision:** **CLOSE_RECIPE_NO_GAIN** for the one-day timing direction recipe; retain seven-day/control products in their existing scopes. F2mean loses20decisions and F3mean loses8 against their own baselines; medians tie or loseone. This longer panel does not establish that all freshness, role or receiving-profile mechanisms fail. No probability claim is added to C’s original two-week law panel.

## 4. What actually advanced, and what remains qualified

These exact products now have five scored season-weeks on the annual diagnostic panel: **duration only**, not inherited base history or automatic primary approval. Timing, support, superiority and operational admission remain separate; no five-new-future-week wait.

No historical season added. Missing exact annual-source join cells for2026 W6–8 and prior-season actual-offer cells remain queued (other W8 panels remain preserved) with line/source/history dependencies. Preserve [prior A results and adverse diagnostics](../profile-increment-to-release-01/closure-next-02/) without reruns. Defense effects remain in completed C03/R0–R3 evidence; none fitted here.

## 5. Genuine packets, producer and website state

- **C frozen75:** `C-C04-20261110-W10-FIRST-01`,25 players×3reception procedures, one WAS–NYG game, issued2026-11-10 19:37:43.972513 UTC; server run 42889831779 persisted/completed19:55:36 UTC. **Zero offers and zero selected sides.** KickoffNov 13 01:15UTC (Nov 12 7:15p.m.CST), still future; grade only when qualified final outcomes arrive. Fresh-display expiry is **Nov 12 03:34:29UTC**, before kickoff; retain original bytes for later grading. C owns this grading. Native missing/duplicate event checks hold the other13 W10 games.
- **Original incumbent:** preserve the earlier1610-forecast c134 packet. Later `01a283a2...`: 1,614 forecasts / 424 player-games / 14 games, generated 20:46:29 UTC, captured 20:46:31 UTC; separate refresh. Scheduled run 42898382015 succeeded20:45:25–20:53:09 UTC. Quote clocks remain unverified; these counts are forecasts.
- **Served state:** readback22:49UTC reports `DISABLED_USE_R0`,0selected research rows/2027reference fallbacks, pointer/hash match. No CountA activation verified. C research site has owner-local75-row browser parity plus separately verified public bytes; A did not execute public browser/mobile DOM verification. No original-site model consumption established.
- **A current-shadow inputs:** current C source bytes and all seven ACT WAS/NYG RB candidates exist. Not starter/health probabilities. Exact fresh A F0/F3 rolling history still needs the compatible dense weekly roster/presence/participation census, qualified game-version/finality map and real observation clocks. C’s retained PBP projection also omits **EPA actually consumed by F3**. Keep all 13 held W9 games excluded. Sparse stats cannot replace dense census or turn absence into zero. This is a precise source-contract gap, not generic raw-data absence.
- **CountA is separate:** existing registered A producer still needs current `SOURCE.json`, qualified query completion, `feature_capture_receipt` and a real repaired issuedRoot (≤61440serialized bytes including issuance fields), followed by permitted derived publication and original-owner admission. F3’s EPA requirement is **not a CountA prerequisite unless CountA’s own bound recipe consumes it**. Corrected `FORECASTS.parquet.point` is the stored mean; old `legacy_point` is mixed fallback and old `mean` isNaN. Do not repeat completed restoration or substitute barepredict/median.

Receipts, owner lease 178 and clocks: [readback refresh](RECEIPT_AND_CAPTURE_REFRESH_V1.json), [current source qualification](CURRENT_SHADOW_SOURCE_QUALIFICATION_V1.json). C at d3d1 acknowledges older A1511/B0503 aggregates. Superseding B b046 explicitly acknowledges A375’s completed C03/CMP joins and checks19,139 public arithmetic items; private membership/clocks remain unknown to B. **No B/C acknowledgment or C admission of this new timing-result package is observed.** Do not repeat either set of joins.

### New B shadow receipt and current expiry

B `B-F0-F2-20261110-W10-FIRST-01` actually published ten completion forecasts (five ACT-conditional QB candidates×F0/F2), plus six explicit basic-unavailable method records. It has **zero actual offers, selected sides or grades**. Issued **November10 5:01:29p.m.CST (23:01:29UTC)**; immutable GitHub readback at5:03:10p.m.CST. Native receipt expires **5:30:18p.m.CST (23:30:18UTC)**; after expiry it remains a frozen forecast for later grading, not a fresh routing/repricing source. Two current-origin fits were performed by **B**, none by A. V2 corrects six metadata flags without changing any value, law, identity or clock; original packet preserved. No original-site delivery/admission/activation. [Superseding receipts](RECEIPT_AND_CAPTURE_REFRESH_V2.json).

C’s issue time above is November10 **1:37:43p.m.CST**; original-site newer capture is **2:46:31p.m.CST**. These counts are forecasts, and both source timing and eligible player scope remain exactly as captured.

## 6. All twelve category/product dispositions and next executor

Package decisions only. Original-site overlay remains R0 fallback; no A activation.

| Category | Numerical / direction / probability / selector disposition | Next owned action or exact dependency |
|---|---|---|
| pass_yd | Retain existing candidates; no new timing join here; no new release | B: next qualified coverage; website owner: eligible admission. |
| pass_td | Existing CountA delivery **BLOCKED** at current producer receipt, not a new fit | A producer: current SOURCE/query/issuedRoot; website owner: admit/verify valid feed. |
| pass_cmp | New five-week point/law diagnostic complete; timing replacement **INCONCLUSIVE**, retain52/88 compatible learned controls | B: acknowledge scoped results; A: qualified W6–8 offers. |
| pass_att | Prior exact joins complete; no new timing replacement claimed | A/B: retain completed ATT; add only missing exact-version coverage. |
| pass_int | No new profile/timing evidence in this package; keep existing eligible path | A/B producer owners: exact offered-line and current-feed evidence. |
| rush_yd | Prior A five-week signal **INCONCLUSIVE** for replacement; no rerun | A/C: compatible current census/finality/EPA; A: preserve adverse results. |
| rush_att | Closed negative allocation/carry recipes remain closed; no new policy | A: qualified role/opportunity follow-on; capture ready references. |
| rec | Exact C04 five-week point replay complete; **CLOSE_RECIPE_NO_GAIN** for one-day direction; retain stronger compatible239/412 procedure for existing review scope | C: intake exact evidence and grade frozen packet; website owner: admission. |
| rec_yd | No new exact-line timing decision; prior context/source limits preserved | C: finite receiving coverage/source work; no invented tracking. |
| rush_rec_yd | No new compatible composite offered-line panel | A/C: component-complete outcomes, exact rule and matching offer. |
| anytime_td | **BLOCKED** for this package’s offered-event comparison | Source/product owner: event offer and compatible TD/participation/settlement contract. |
| nick-chart-ppr-v1 | **BLOCKED** for this package’s offered/chart product | Label/website owners: exact chart-offer and 16-primitive grade contract. |

Top Picks: website owner leads the exact changed selector replay; B verifies, C records. Category history does not qualify a changed ranker. Keep independent display/direction paths isolated; missing replay must not block eligible releases.

## 7. Reproducibility and durable-publication stages

This report formats existing aggregates only; no regrading. Formatting environmentPython3.12.14. Root execution code/configuration, bootstrap seed and command bindings are in the [B scoring GO](B_TIMING_COMPLETION_SCORING_GO_V1.json), [C scoring GO](C04_SCORING_GO_V1.json), and independent receipts.

Full weekly/cumulative records, controls, paired intervals and member-hash bindings: [B public table index](b-timing-public-v1/INDEX.csv), [C public table index](c04-public-v1/INDEX.csv). Failures/corrections remain preserved. Five exposed week clusters, repeated players and multiple views limit bootstrap interpretation; crossing zero does not prove equivalence. Publication, acknowledgement and use remain separate.

**Boundary:** saved-output joins complete. Current A source closure, CountA issuance, selector replay, missing periods and consumer receipts retain their owners. No new fit, inference, selection or release; independently eligible delivery/capture continues.

## 8. Final execution, retention and handoff

- **Zero A fits/inference/new original picks.** Saved-output scoring used21.003CPU-seconds for B and202.415 for C04 including C native persistence; the rejected C command-token attempt used0.037CPU-seconds and remains retained. Separate A calculations verified B’s new summaries/laws/partitions and C’s384 timing/alias summaries plus588 paired cells. They do not imply external-session acceptance or peer fresh-fit reproduction.
- Root’s final retention/readback used **172.253CPU-seconds /173.307wall-seconds /179,036,160B RSS**. Four native members restored exactly. Existing freshness charge is **9,478,861/16,777,216B**; all older caps, failure reserves and capture reserves remain unchanged. [Final native receipt](NATIVE_RETENTION_RECEIPT_V1.json). No new shared archive.
- **71 aggregate files /3,750,353 UTF8 bytes** published at immutable commit **60354cb8bcca731b10773072669504c1ed5502c8**; every remote file matches exact content and Git blob identity. [Readback](PUBLIC_AGGREGATE_READBACK_V1.json). Public tables grant no private-row/source-clock/model access.
- New exports, source bindings, rights, product decisions and exact owner dependencies: [machine result](EXECUTION_SUMMARY_V1.json) and [actual receipt acknowledgments](EXACT_RECEIPTS_ACKNOWLEDGED_V1.json). C intake/B independent follow-up use these bytes; publication is not assumed receipt or admission.

### Separate side leaders and numerical controls, annual-source panel

These are own-pool maxima among the compared procedures, not a tested combined router. Completion Over has tied73.33% records11–4/15, including B F0 lower-median/P2 and F2mean; completion Under leader A HGB is26–22/48 (54.17%). Reception Over leader C P1median is62–35/97 (63.92%); reception Under leader A Leafmean is126–89/215 (58.60%). Their side subsets differ. Full ties and every procedure’s other side remain in machine tables.

The best retained numerical controls on the same annual decided rows also differ from direction leaders: A Leafmean completion MAE **4.45908** (88rows); A CountA empirical/corrected-point reception MAE **1.70687** (412rows; these two views coincide here). New timing products do not establish a replacement over those controls. These are historical measured products, not a new deployment recommendation.
